Submission Notes

7. Hedge bot tweaked to not stick to map edges quite so much...

6. Hedge algorithm for probabalistically applying different strategies. Code got bloated. I don't think I'll be able to look at another python program for a year without throwing up.

5. Oops. Forgot to zip some of the files.

4. KMeans clustering. Ants now maintain different distance for different types of goals. Many kludgey policies for growth and interaction. Berzerker mode at 125 ants.

3. Naive pathfinding. Simple goal assignment and elimination. Gale-Shapley to prevent ants stepping on eachother.

2. Brownian motion.

1. Forgot to remove logging code. Too excited!
